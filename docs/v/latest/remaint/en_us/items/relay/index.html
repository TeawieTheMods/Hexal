      <meta property="og:description" content="Often I wish to link together multiple wisps, so that they can share media and information over long distances. However running long chains of wisps to transfer these over great distances is inconvenient, and has great upkeep costs. To resolve this issue I have made Relays. Since they are solid blocks rather than media constructs themselves, they are able to maintain the links without any upkeep costs at all." />
